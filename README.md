## About Me

As a seasoned professional in Data Science and Data Engineering, I specialize in leveraging advanced machine learning, multimodal learning, and generative AI to solve complex business challenges. My expertise includes deploying models like GPT, BERT, and LLaMA, integrating LangChain with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for enhanced contextual responses, and building interactive applications using frameworks like Hugging Face and Streamlit. I excel in predictive analytics, time-series forecasting, and statistical modeling, delivering impactful insights through advanced visualizations in Tableau and Power BI.

In Data Engineering, I design and implement scalable data pipelines, automate workflows, and integrate systems to streamline operations. With a strong foundation in SQL, Python, Hadoop, and cloud platforms like AWS and Azure, I lead the development of robust ETL processes and transition data solutions into real-time APIs. My efforts drive efficiency, improve data accessibility, and enable data-driven decision-making, ensuring alignment with organizational goals.
